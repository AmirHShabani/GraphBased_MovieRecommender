# Graph-Based Movie Recommender System: A Personalized Approach Using MovieLens

In order to help users find relevant and personalized content in an ocean of information, recommender systems are an essential and frequently used part of machine learning. These systems create personalized recommendations for users based on historical user interactions with different materials, including movies, products, and articles.
 
 In this project, we try to create our own movie recommender system using graphs, a powerful data structure that can capture the complex relationships between entities. we use the MovieLens dataset, which contains millions of ratings and tags from thousands of users and movies. We also use the Neo4j graph database, which allows us to store, query, and manipulate graph data efficiently. We explore various techniques to generate personalized recommendations for users, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering. Also design and implement a web interface for users to interact with the system and visualize the results.
